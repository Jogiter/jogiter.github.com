00:01.290 --> 00:05.870
Never before our world is changing.

00:05.870 --> 00:09.191
Faced with some of our most critical challenges,

00:09.191 --> 00:11.990
human ingenuity triumphs.

00:13.910 --> 00:14.356
Today,

00:14.356 --> 00:18.818
the Microsoft AI for Good initiative enables a person with

00:18.818 --> 00:22.015
an idea to accelerate it, to give it scale,

00:22.015 --> 00:25.470
to create change for the better.

00:25.680 --> 00:29.325
Microsoft AI will help our work by empowering people to

00:29.325 --> 00:31.539
take action. Through AI for Earth,

00:31.539 --> 00:34.729
photos can now help save a species. With AI for

00:34.729 --> 00:38.049
accessibility, the visual world becomes an audible,

00:38.049 --> 00:41.695
experience sanitary and peanut butter. And with AI for

00:41.695 --> 00:42.997
humanitarian action,

00:42.997 --> 00:46.904
first responders can target their efforts faster than ever

00:46.904 --> 00:48.070
before.

00:48.070 --> 00:52.303
It feels humbling to know that I'm actually helping another

00:52.303 --> 00:54.150
human being.

00:54.480 --> 00:54.858
Today,

00:54.858 --> 00:58.703
we are empowering others to forge new paths to fight famine

00:58.703 --> 01:01.792
before crisis strikes and protect ecosystems. By

01:01.792 --> 01:04.439
identifying forests down to a single tree,

01:04.439 --> 01:08.284
we have the forest that we have today. We can't change that.

01:08.284 --> 01:12.004
What we can change is the future. Microsoft AI is fueling

01:12.004 --> 01:15.471
some of the most passionate and creative people on our

01:15.471 --> 01:19.127
planet with the help of citizen scientists to make change

01:19.127 --> 01:21.030
once thought impossible.

01:21.030 --> 01:25.388
Real AI will know and understand and model based on the

01:25.388 --> 01:27.790
child interaction.

01:28.120 --> 01:31.301
AI unleashes new possibilities to impact our world,

01:31.301 --> 01:35.920
and together, we're not just dreaming it, we're doing it.
